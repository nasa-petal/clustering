Moreover, they construct silk webs on underwater vegetation and create an air-filled bubble, the ‘diving bell’ (Fig 1B). The air is held by surface tension between the silk fibres, and the chamber is open on the bottom. Smaller diving bells accommodate the abdomen only, but larger ones allow the whole spider to move in and out through the bottom. They fill the bell by sequentially carrying large bubbles from the surface, held with the abdomen and fine hairs on the rear legs.” (Seymore &amp; Hetz 2011:2175)</p>\\n', '<p>“The unique ability of Argyroneta aquatica to form a diving bell web was re-examined using a new approach in a structurally simplified environment.

Due to the hydrophilic property of the web, small air bubbles could not pass this composite and remained perfectly spherical at the contact point. As revealed using Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the hydrogel and the silken threads are proteinaceous.

This unusual mechanism relies on a combination of three-dimensional cellular geometry and anisotropic cell wall properties of the fruit epidermis. Moreover, we show that the stored potential energy giving rise to tissue tension is released explosively via coiling of the fruit valves. This coiling mechanism requires the asymmetric localization of lignin in a single cell layer of the valve and represents an evolutionary novelty associated with explosive seed dispersal across the genus Cardamine.”</p>\\n', '<p>“Geometry is also key to the rapid release of stored energy in <em>C. hirsuta</em> — geometry of the fruit valve, but ultimately the geometry of a cell wall in a single cell layer of the valve. Cells in the inner (endocarp b) layer of the valve are asymmetrically thickened by a lignified secondary cell wall on their inner face. Lignin is precisely deposited in these cells to form three stiff rods connected by very thin hinges. The fruit valve needs to coil along its length to reach its relaxed state, but its transverse curvature prevents this. Opening these hinged cell walls flattens the cross-section of the valve, which removes this energy barrier, allowing the sudden release of elastic energy.

Giant larvaceans in the genus <i>Bathochordaeus</i> are generally an order of magnitude larger (at 3- to 10-cm total length as adults), and they create large houses that can exceed 1 m in greatest dimension. <i>Bathochordaeus</i> houses consist of an outer structure that excludes large particles and a fine-mesh inner filter to concentrate particles of the appropriate size for ingestion. The inner filter of a <i>Bathochordaeus</i> house has a tail chamber that receives the particle-laden water propelled by the animal’s beating tail. The tail chamber directs water into the two fluted arms of the inner feeding filter, where particles are entrained and carried into the animal’s mouth via a buccal tube. When its feeding structure becomes clogged, a larvacean discards its mucus house and builds another. For smaller species, this can occur on an hourly basis; for giant larvaceans, replacement intervals can be daily. Discarded houses are typically rich in nutrients; large ones collapse and sink rapidly to the deep seafloor, circumventing the microbial degradation that mineralizes the organic content of smaller, more slowly sinking detritus. Through this process, giant larvaceans contribute significantly to the biological pump and can be regionally responsible for as much as one-third of the carbon flux from near-surface waters to the deep benthos.&#8221; (Katija et al. 2017: 1)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '97034-0'}\n",

The outlines of bones, therefore, follow the stress lines or are vertical to them so that they give an indication of the pressures the bone has to withstand. But this ideal distribution of bone material along the stress lines would have been to little avail were the material itself not so well adapted to extraordinary pressure. Just like fiberglass made of synthetics threaded with glass fiber, bone tissue is made up of two constituents which greatly differ in their mechanical properties. About half the bone volume is made up of inorganic crystalline material. It consists of phosphate, calcium, and hydroxyl ions and comes very close to hydroxylapatite in structure. It appears in the bone in the form of tiny crystals, only about 200 atomic diameters in size. They are inserted between thin fiber hairs of the elastic material collagen and seem to be linked with them. Many of these parallel inorganic and organic building blocks form fascicles, which may be interwoven in various ways. The end product is a material that is considerably stiffer than collagen, though low in weight, but by far not as brittle and inelastic as pure hydroxylapatite. Besides, because of the continuous alternation between brittle and elastic material, there is little chance for a fracture to spread unchecked.&#8221; (Tributsch 1984:32-33)</p>\\n', '<p>&#8220;Mineralized collagen fibrils are highly conserved nanostructural building blocks of bone. By a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and theoretical analysis it is shown that the characteristic nanostructure of mineralized collagen fibrils is vital for its high strength and its ability to sustain large deformation, as is relevant to the physiological role of bone, creating a strong and tough material. An analysis of the molecular mechanisms of protein and mineral phases under large deformation of mineralized collagen fibrils reveals a fibrillar toughening mechanism that leads to a manifold increase of energy dissipation compared to fibrils without mineral phase. This fibrillar toughening mechanism increases the resistance to fracture by forming large local yield regions around crack-like defects, a mechanism that protects the integrity of the entire structure by allowing for localized failure. As a consequence, mineralized collagen fibrils are able to tolerate microcracks of the order of several hundred micrometres in size without causing any macroscopic failure of the tissue, which may be essential to enable bone remodelling. The analysis proves that adding nanoscopic small platelets to collagen fibrils increases their Young&#8217;s modulus and yield strength as well as their fracture strength. We find that mineralized collagen fibrils have a Young&#8217;s modulus of 6.23 GPa (versus 4.59 GPa for the collagen fibril), yield at a tensile strain of 6.7% (versus 5% for the collagen fibril) and feature a fracture stress of 0.6 GPa (versus 0.3 GPa for the collagen fibril).&#8221; (Buehler 2007:1)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '5068-0'}\n",

Chemoautotrophic symbionts require access to oxygen from the water column and reduced compounds, i.e. sulfide or methane, from the seep. During periods of carbon fixation, a boundary layer depleted in one or more of these solutes likely develops, which limits epibiont productivity… We hypothesize that <i>K. puravida</i> waves its chelipeds to shear off boundary layers formed by their epibionts productivity, increasing both the epibionts and, in turn, their own access to food… boundary layers are greatest in areas of reduced flow, such as pits and depressions, which is a habitat where <i>K. puravida</i> commonly occurs, making this behavior even more adaptive.

Furthermore, VOCs released from the attacked plant parts can also serve as airborne phytohormones inducing defense responses in the non-attacked tissues of the same plant or of neighboring plants. Together, there is increasing evidence that induced VOC emissions are an important part of defense strategies against herbivorous insects that plants have evolved owing to their sessile nature.” (Staudt et al., 2010: 1320)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '96069-0'}\n",

It relies on a complicated physiological structure and an elaborate balance between tissue elasticity, collagen fibre anisotropy, active muscular contraction, stress release and geometry. A general biophysical model for the dynamics of the chameleon tongue based on large deformation elasticity is proposed. The model involves three distinct coupled subsystems: the energetics of the intralingual sheaths, the mechanics of the activating accelerator muscle and the dynamics of tongue extension. Together, these three systems elucidate the key physical principles of prey-catching among chameleonides.”</p>\\n', '<p>“To capture prey, chameleons ballistically project their tongues as far as 1.5 body lengths with accelerations of up to 500 m s–2. At the core of a chameleon’s tongue is a cylindrical tongue skeleton surrounded by the accelerator muscle. The key structure in the projection mechanism is probably a cylindrical connective–tissue layer, which surrounds the entoglossal process. … This tissue layer comprises at least 10 sheaths that envelop the entoglossal process. The outer portion connects anteriorly to the accelerator muscle and the inner portion to the retractor structures. The sheaths contain helical arrays of collagen fibres. Prior to projection, the sheaths are longitudinally loaded by the combined radial contraction and hydrostatic lengthening of the accelerator muscle, at an estimated mean power of 144 W kg–1\\xa0in\\xa0<i>C. melleri</i>. Tongue projection is triggered as the accelerator muscle and the loaded portions of the sheaths start to slide over the tip of the entoglossal process. The springs relax radially while pushing off the rounded tip of the entoglossal process, making the elastic energy stored in the helical fibres available for a simultaneous forward acceleration of the tongue pad, accelerator muscle and retractor structures. The energy release continues as the multilayered spring slides over the tip of the smooth and lubricated entoglossal process… Thus, we have identified a unique catapult mechanism that is very different from standard engineering designs.”</p>\\n', '<p>“[S]mall chameleons are able to project their tongues proportionately longer distances, with projection lengths reaching 2.5 body lengths. Additionally, small chameleon species are shown to be capable of producing peak accelerations during tongue projection of up to 2,590\\u2009m s−2, or 264\\u2009<i>g</i>\\xa0and mass-specific power output values during tongue projection of up to 14,040\\u2009W kg−1, values that are the highest reported among amniotes. These scaling relationships not only highlight the previously underestimated performance capability of the family, but also the potential utility of taking body size into account when testing for movements harbouring cryptic power amplification mechanisms and how varying metabolic demands may help drive morphological evolution.”</p>\\n', '<p>“Environmental temperature impacts the physical activity and ecology of ectothermic animals through its effects on muscle contractile physiology. Sprinting, swimming, and jumping performance of ectotherms decreases by at least 33% over a 10 °C drop, accompanied by a similar decline in muscle power. We propose that ballistic movements that are powered by recoil of elastic tissues are less thermally dependent than movements that rely on direct muscular power. We found that an elastically powered movement, ballistic tongue projection in chameleons, maintains high performance over a 20 °C range. Peak velocity and power decline by only 10%–19% with a 10 °C drop, compared to &gt;42% for nonelastic, muscle-powered tongue retraction. These results indicate that the elastic recoil mechanism circumvents the constraints that low temperature imposes on muscle rate properties and thereby reduces the thermal dependence of tongue projection.”</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '4734-0'}\n",

A well-studied example is the formation of recruitment trails in ant colonies, but many ant species do not use pheromone trails. We present a model of the regulation of foraging by harvester ant (<em>Pogonomyrmex barbatus</em>) colonies. This species forages for scattered seeds that one ant can retrieve on its own, so there is no need for spatial information such as pheromone trails that lead ants to specific locations. Previous work shows that colony foraging activity, the rate at which ants go out to search individually for seeds, is regulated in response to current food availability throughout the colony&#8217;s foraging area. Ants use the rate of brief antennal contacts inside the nest between foragers returning with food and outgoing foragers available to leave the nest on the next foraging trip. Here we present a feedback-based algorithm that captures the main features of data from field experiments in which the rate of returning foragers was manipulated. The algorithm draws on our finding that the distribution of intervals between successive ants returning to the nest is a Poisson process. We fitted the parameter that estimates the effect of each returning forager on the rate at which outgoing foragers leave the nest. We found that correlations between observed rates of returning foragers and simulated rates of outgoing foragers, using our model, were similar to those in the data. Our simple stochastic model shows how the regulation of ant colony foraging can operate without spatial information, describing a process at the level of individual ants that predicts the overall foraging activity of the colony.&#8221; (Prabhakar et al. 2012: 1)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '5091-0'}\n",

It has been proposed that acylglucosylceramides serve as molecular &#8216;rivets&#8217; to promote flattening and stacking of lipid vesicles that subsequently fuse edge-to-edge to produce lamellae comprising paired bilayers that are stacked parallel to the skin surface (Engström et al., 2000; Wertz, 2000).

On drying, the keratin recrystallizes, shrinks, and the barbules recoil, so the process is completely reversible.” (Maclean 1983:367)</span></p>\\n', '<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“The barbules of sandgrouse belly feathers are also coiled at the base, but much more strongly than those of wader feathers, and the hooked barbicels that give most feathers structural cohesion have been entirely lost. Each barbule ends in a terminal filament about 0.3 mm long which stands up at right angles to the feather vane when the wet barbule uncoils; the resulting bed of hairs is dense and capable of holding a substantial amount of water. The belly plumage of a male Namaqua sandgrouse can hold an average of 22 ml, that of a female about 9 ml.” (Maclean 1985:6)</span></p>\\n', '']}, 'objectID': '90811-0'}\n",

Such a mixture, if comprising edible or ornamental plants, would be economically viable, would reduce the need for additional chemical and biological control, and, if used outdoors, would generate plant-diverse agro-ecosystems that are better able to harbour invertebrate wildlife.” (Conboy et al. 2019: 1-2)</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This indicates that repellent volatile organic compounds [aka volatile organic compounds from plant origin, or VPCs]\\xa0 from marigold are the probable cause of the reduction in whitefly performance on tomato intercropped with marigold (Fig 1).” (Conboy et al. 2019: 5)</span></p>\\n', '<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Manipulating the odorscapes of herbivorous pest species has already important practical implications in plant protection as an alternative to pesticides… Modifying the odorscape by introducing other plant species that naturally release different VPCs can also reduce the damage caused by pest insects.” (Conchou et al. 2019: 13-14)\\xa0</span></p>\\n', '<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our findings indicate that plants may contribute to the suppression</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of herbivore populations, not only through low average quality but also through heterogeneity in nutrient levels… A key implication is that agroecosystems may experience outbreaks of herbivores because herbivore performance is increased by artificially low plant heterogeneity owing to landscape simplification, reduced plant species diversity and crops that are bred to minimize variation. Increasing heterogeneity in plant nutrients in agroecosystems may be a key step towards the sustainable control of insect pests. Plant nutrient heterogeneity could be increased by planting greater numbers of crop varieties21, by increasing genetic diversity within crop varieties, or by breeding varieties with increased constitutive or induced nutrient variance within the parts of the plant that are attacked by insect pests.” (Wetzel et al. 2016: 427)</span></p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '88190-0'}\n",

Such relationships have been demonstrated in several natural systems…Colicinogenic [E. coli] bacteria possess a ‘col’ plasmid, containing genes that encode the colicin (the toxin), a colicin-specific immunity protein (which renders the cell immune to the colicin) and a lysis protein (which is expressed when the cell is under stress, causing partial cell lysis [the disintegration of a cell by rupture of the cell wall or membrane]and the subsequent release of the colicin). In general, only a small fraction of a population of colicinogenic cells will lyse and release the colicin. Colicin-sensitive bacteria are killed by the colicin but may occasionally experience mutations that render them resistant to the colicin. The most common mutations alter cell membrane proteins that bind or translocate the colicin. In some cases, the growth rate of resistant cells (R) will exceed that of colicinogenic cells (C), but will be less than the growth rate of sensitive cells (S). This occurs because resistant cells avoid the competitive cost of carrying the col plasmid but suffer because colicin receptor and translocation proteins are also involved in crucial cell functions such as nutrient uptake. In such cases, S can displace R (because S has a growth-rate advantage), R can displace C (because R has a growth-rate advantage) and C can displace S (because C kills S). That is, the C–S–R community satisfies a rock–paper–scissors relationship.” (Kerr et al. 2002:171)</p>\\n', '', '', '']}, 'objectID': '87380-0'}\n",

However, microclimatic amelioration due to canopy shading had the strongest effect, which was particularly pronounced in the drier site. Below-ground, shrubs did not modify soil physical characteristics, organic matter, total N and P, or water content, but significantly increased available K, which has been shown to improve seedling water-use efficiency under drought conditions. Conclusions: We propose that in Mediterranean montane ecosystems, characterised by a severe summer drought, pioneer shrubs represent a major safe site for tree early recruitment during secondary succession, improving seedling survival during summer by the modification of both the above- and below-ground environment.&#8221; (Gómez-Aparicio et al. 2005:191)</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The canopy effect due to microclimate amelioration was the main mechanism enhancing seedling survival and growth (see also Valiente-Banuet &amp; Ezcurra 1991; Valiente-Banuet et al. 1991; Greenlee &amp; Callaway 1996; and Maestre et al. 2001). Lower air and soil tempera- tures, radiation and vapor pressure deficit measured below shrub canopies in comparison to open areas re- duced leaf temperature and transpiration losses, conse- quently inducing a more favourable water balance in tree seedlings.&#8221; (Gomez-Aparicio et al. 2005:197)</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Shade appears to be a necessary condition for seedling establishment of several Mediterranean woody species (Gómez 2004; Castro et al. 2004a; Gómez-Aparicio et al. 2005).&#8221; (Gomez-Aparicio et al. 2005:192)</p>\\n<p>&#8220;However, nurse shrubs effectively modified one soil property, available K [potassium], being in all cases higher under shrubs than in open interspaces. Potassium seems to increase plant resistance to drought, mainly due to os- motic adjustments and a reduction in transpiration rates, which in turn involves a higher water-use efficiency (Bradbury &amp; Malcom 1977; van den Driessche 1991; Egilla et al. 2001).&#8221; (Gomez-Aparicio et al. 2005:196)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '5076-0'}\n",

By directly measuring air velocities and temperatures within the mound, we see that the overall mechanisms and patterns involved are similar to that in the south Asian species.” (Ocko et al. 2017:3260)</p>\\n', '<p>“As it is in lungs, the colony’s respiratory function is dominated by a mixed-phase regime that is sandwiched between the subterranean structures (where natural convection dominates), and the upper parts and peripheral air spaces of the mound (where wind-driven forced convection dominates). By our best estimates, this mixed natural/forced convection regime occupies the lower parts of the chimney and the deeper parts of the mound reticulum [15].” (Turner and Soar 2008:222)</p>\\n<p>“In most building designs, walls are erected as barriers to isolate spaces: internal spaces from the outside world,internal spaces from one another and so forth. Yet spaces, if they are to be occupied and used, cannot be isolated. Resolving this paradox is what forces building designs to include infrastructure—windows, fans, ducts, air conditioning, heating etc—all essentially to undo what the erection of the walls did in the first place. In short, the paradox forces building design toward what we call the “building-as-machine” paradigm (BAM).</p>\\n<p>Living systems, which also are avid space-creators, resolve the paradox in a different way: by erecting walls that are not barriers but adaptive interfaces, where fluxes of matter and energy across the wall are not blocked but are managed by the wall itself [28, 29]. This is illustrated dramatically in the complex architecture of the interface that termites build—the mound—to manage the environment in their collectively constructed space—the nest [30].” (Turner and Soar 2008:225)</p>\\n', '', '', '']}, 'objectID': '5105-0'}\n",

This is puzzling, given the number of naturally salt-tolerant grass species. To better understand why salt-tolerance occurs naturally but is difficult to breed into crop species, we take a novel, biodiversity-based approach to its study, examining the evolutionary lability of salt-tolerance across the grass family. We analyse the phylogenetic distribution of naturally salt-tolerant species on a phylogeny of 2684 grasses, and find that salt-tolerance has evolved over 70 times, in a wide range of grass lineages. These results are confirmed by repeating the analysis at genus level on a phylogeny of over 800 grass genera. While salt-tolerance evolves surprisingly often, we find that its evolution does not often give rise to a large clade of salt-tolerant species. These results suggest that salt-tolerance is an evolutionarily labile trait in grasses&#8221; (Bennett 2013:1)</p>\\n', '', '']}, 'objectID': '84506-0'}\n",

At sharp angles of attack, however, serrations comb through the air like a plough through a field.

It is well documented that marine fish must drink seawater to combat diffusive water loss to a hyperosmotic environment. As imbibed seawater passes through the gut, Na+ and Cl− absorption occurs via Na+:Cl− and Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporters, in addition to apical Cl−/HCO3− exchange. Water follows this salt absorption, leaving behind Mg2+ and SO4 − at concentrations often more than three times those of seawater. In contrast, HCO3 − is present in the gut of marine teleosts at values up to 50 times seawater levels as a result of apical Cl−/HCO3 – exchange within the intestine. Bicarbonate secretion may also play a role in calcium homeostasis, inhibiting intestinal Ca2+ absorption by precipitating CaCO3 which is subsequently excreted.

Penguins in a huddle are packed so tightly that individual movements become impossible, reminiscent of a jamming transition in compacted colloids. It is crucial, however, that the huddle structure is continuously reorganized to give each penguin a chance to spend sufficient time inside the huddle, compared with time spent on the periphery. Here we show that Emperor penguins move collectively in a highly coordinated manner to ensure mobility while at the same time keeping the huddle packed. Every 30–60 seconds, all penguins make small steps that travel as a wave through the entire huddle. Over time, these small movements lead to large-scale reorganization of the huddle. Our data show that the dynamics of penguin huddling is governed by intermittency and approach to kinetic arrest in striking analogy with inert non-equilibrium systems, including soft glasses and colloids.&#8221; (Zitterbart et al. 2011:e20260)</p>\\n', '<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;Social thermoregulation is a cooperative strategy in which animals actively aggregate to benefit from the warmth of conspecifics in response to low ambient temperatures. Emperor penguins, Aptenodytes forsteri, use this behaviour to ensure their survival and reproduction during the Antarctic winter. An emperor penguin colony consists of a dynamic mosaic of compact zones, the so-called huddles, included in a looser network of individuals. To maximize energy savings, birds should adjust their huddling behaviour according to environmental conditions. Here, we examined the dynamics of emperor penguin aggregations, based on photo and video records, in relation to climatic factors. Environmental temperature, wind and solar radiation were the main factors contributing to huddle formation. The analysis of individual movements showed that birds originating from loose aggregations continually joined huddles. Sometimes, a small number of birds induced a movement that propagated to the entire huddle, causing its breakup within 2 min and releasing birds, which then integrated into looser aggregations. Different parts of the colony therefore appeared to continually exchange individuals in response to environmental conditions. A likely explanation is that individuals in need of warmth join huddles, whereas individuals seeking to dissipate heat break huddles apart. The regular growth and decay of huddles operates as pulses through which birds gain, conserve or lose heat. Originally proposed to account for reducing energy expenditure, the concept of social thermoregulation appears to cover a highly dynamic phenomenon that fulfils a genuine regulatory function in emperor penguins.&#8221;\\xa0 (Ancel et al. 2015: 91)</span></p>\\n', '', '']}, 'objectID': '4611-0'}\n",

Poorwills used torpor extensively whenever ambient temperature (Ta) dropped below 10° C, and there was little evidence for thermoregulation when Ta was above 5° C. During the winter months (December through February), birds remained entirely inactive on 72% of bird-nights, and continuously inactive periods of 10 days or longer were common. The extent of inactivity is similar behaviorally to that of hibernating small mammals. Roost selection, however, facilitated routine passive solar warming, and inactive birds exhibited a regular pattern of arousal on sunny days, followed by reentry into torpor at sunset. We argue that daily arousals are likely an adaptation to the circumstances that characterize surface dormancy. We hypothesize that the relationship between Ta and availability of flying insects at night, in combination with unique ecological aspects of arid regions, contributed to the evolution of multiday torpor use by poorwills.&#8221; (Woods et al. 2004:231)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '3724-0'}\n",

This large concentration gradient between the oceans and the atmosphere drives almost half the biogenic sulfur flux to the earth&#8217;s atmosphere. DMS constitutes about 90% of the flux of biogenic sulfur from the ocean to the atmosphere. As a result, considerable attention has been focused on the distribution and dynamics of DMS in ocean water in an effort to understand mechanisms controlling its flux to the atmosphere. The DMS in seawater appears to originate from algae, most likely produced by the decomposition of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a tertiary sulfonium compound analogous to the quaternary ammonium compounds (for example, glycinebetaine and proline) that are widespread in marine organisms. As with these ammonium compounds, DMSP may be involved in regulating cellular osmotic pressure in algae. Decomposition of DMSP appears to occur mainly by an enzymatically catalyzed elimination reaction, yielding DMS and acrylic acid&#8221; (Dacey et al. 1986:1314).</p>\\n', '<p>&#8220;Petrels, albatrosses and other procellariiform seabirds have an excellent sense of smell, and routinely navigate over the world&#8217;s oceans by mechanisms that are not well understood. These birds travel thousands of kilometres to forage on ephemeral prey patches at variable locations, yet they can quickly and efficiently find their way back to their nests on remote islands to provision chicks, even with magnetic senses experimentally disrupted. Over the seemingly featureless ocean environment, local emissions of scents released by phytoplankton reflect bathymetric features such as shelf breaks and seamounts. These features suggest an odour landscape that may provide birds with orientation cues. We have previously shown that concentrated experimental deployments of one such compound, dimethyl sulphide (DMS), attracts procellariiforms at sea, suggesting that some species can use it as a foraging cue. Here we present the first physiological demonstration that an Antarctic seabird can detect DMS at biogenic levels. We further show that birds can use DMS as an orientation cue in a non-foraging context within a concentration range that they might naturally encounter over the ocean&#8221; (Nevitt et al. 2005:303)</p>\\n', '', '']}, 'objectID': '3329-0'}\n",

Here, by performing flow-tank measurements of hydrodynamic drag and yaw moments together with computational fluid dynamics simulations, we reverse several assumptions about the hydrodynamic role of the boxfish carapace. Firstly, despite serving as a model system in aerodynamic design, drag-reduction performance was relatively low compared with more generalized fish morphologies. Secondly, the current theory of course stabilization owing to flow over the boxfish carapace was rejected, as destabilizing moments were found consistently.

Within a few hours, it bursts open and starts to spread. Its margin has an up-turned rim, six inches high, so that as it expands it is able to shoulder aside any other floating leaf that gets in its way. Beneath, it is strengthened with girder-like ribs which make the whole structure rigid. They also contain air-spaces within them that keep it afloat. Expanding at the rate of half a square yard in a single day, the leaf grows until it is six feet across. The underside of the leaf is a rich purple colour and armoured with abundant sharp spikes, perhaps as a defence against leaf-eating fish. One plant can produce forty or fifty of such leaves in a single growing season and monopolise the surface so effectively that few plants of other kinds can grow alongside or below it…In 1847, viable seeds did arrive at Kew and there the gardeners managed to get them to germinate. One of the seedlings was sent to Joseph Paxton who was in charge of the Duke of Devonshire&#8217;s splendid gardens at Chatsworth…Paxton was not only a gardener of great skill but an architect of near-genius.

In 1975 Vogt wrote: &#8216;Rays from an object point entering through different facets are superimposed not by refracting systems as in other superposition eyes, but by a radial arrangement of orthogonal reflecting planes which are formed by the sides of the crystalline cones and the purine layers surrounding them.&#8217; As Fig. 8.14 shows, the mirrors direct light to a common focus. Mirrors are inverters, just like the telescopes in refracting superposition eyes (Fig. 8.3b), and so the ray-bending that the two kinds of optical element perform is almost identical. However, problems start to arise when one tries to work out what will happen to rays that are not in the idealized central plane shown in Fig. 8.14b. In general, rays in oblique planes will not encounter just one side of each mirror box, but two. What happens to such rays? Do they, like the singly reflected rays in Fig. 8.14, all reach a common focus?</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It turns out that the square arrangement of the facet array (almost unique to the decapod crustaceans) is crucial here. The principle is that of the &#8216;corner reflector&#8217; [like those mirrors found in corners of stores]…A ray reflected from the two mirrors must be rotated through a total of two right angles, which means that it will return parallel to its original direction, <em>no matter what angle the ray initially makes with the mirror pair</em>. In other words, apart from a slight lateral displacement of the reflected ray, a corner mirror behaves as though it were a single mirror, but one that is always at right angles to the incoming ray. This property turns out to be very useful, for example in radar reflectors for ships and buoys, and it is also the property that makes reflecting superposition possible…</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Various other features of these eyes are important for their function. The mirror boxes must be the right depth, two to three times the width, so that most rays are reflected from two of the faces, but not more. Rays that pass straight through are intercepted by the unsilvered &#8216;tail&#8217; of the mirror boxes, and Vogt (1980) showed that its refractive index decreases in such a way that appropriate critical angle reflexion continues to occur through the clear zone. Finally, there is the weak lens in the cornea of the crayfish. This lens &#8216;pre-focuses&#8217; the light that enters the mirror box, thus given a narrower beam at the retina. All these features provide an image generally comparable in quality to that produced by refracting superposition optics (Bryceson and McIntyre), although it does seem that rays which make too many or too few reflections contribute to measurable stray light (glare) in the image of on the retina.&#8221; (Land and Nilsson 2002:172-174)</p>\\n', '']}, 'objectID': '4558-0'}\n",

Its floating leaves are evenly covered with complex hydrophobic hairs retaining a layer of air when submerged under water. Surprisingly the terminal cells of the hairs are hydrophilic. These hydrophilic patches stabilize the air layer by pinning the air-water interface. This &#8216;Salvinia Effect&#8217; provides an innovative concept to develop biomimetic surfaces with long-term air-retention capabilities for under water applications.&#8221; (Barthlott et al. 2010: 2325)</p>\\n<div>&#8220;To demonstrate the pinning effect, individual eggbeater hairs were dipped into water. From a lateral view the shape and size of the water meniscus created, when pulling the hairs out of the water was recorded…As a measure of the hydrophilicity we took the distance between the tip of the hairs and the water surface at the exact instant when the meniscus snapped off. This experiment was done with untreated hairs and hairs that were rendered hydrophobic by dipping them into a Teflon (polytetra-?uoroethylene, PTFE) solution. The water meniscus could be pulled roughly twice as high by the untreated hair…than by the Teflon coated hair…The function of the eggbeater hairs is obvious – they allow the trapping of a thin air layer reaching from the surface of the plant leaf to the top of the hairs. Penetration of water into this well-defined region requires energy for creating an increased contact area between the water and the hydrophobic hairs.</div>\\n<div></div>\\n<div>This also explains the special eggbeater shape of the structures. In order to stabilize the air–water interface most efficiently, it is desirable that the energy required for the water to penetrate into the region between the hairs is maximized. Therefore it makes sense that the hairs are split into four arms to create as much surface per height difference as possible.</div>\\n<div></div>\\n<div>To enhance this effect even more, these four arms are bent together at the terminal ends, approaching an almost horizontal angle. This leads to a maximization of the additional water-hair contact area per height difference required for the water to penetrate into the air retention area, i.e., to penetrate deeper than the topmost level of the hairs.&#8221; (Barthlott et al. 2010: 2327).</div>\\n', '']}, 'objectID': '4894-0'}\n",

We present two series of below-ground food webs along natural productivity gradients in vegetation successions<sup>5, 6</sup>. The complexity of the food webs increased along the gradients.

They show that it is the heaviest three-link feedback loop in a network of predator–prey effects that limits its stability.

In birds flying in formation, each wing moves in an upwash field that is generated by the wings of the other birds in the formation. Modelling has shown that when birds are flying with optimal spacing, a maximal reduction in power can be achieved and total transport costs can be substantially reduced. However, field observations of V formations indicate that birds often shift from their optimal positioning, perhaps in an attempt to maximize the aerodynamic advantage of flight formation, thus reducing the energy saving— so geese, for example, may make an energy saving of only 2.4%.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In our study, pelicans often had difficulty staying within the formation, particularly when flying at the rear. But even though these birds were regularly adjusting their position, they still achieved a significant energy saving. This saving may be only partly due to effects of the wakes of other birds on the power input that results from formation flight itself. When flying in formation, pelicans appear to beat their wings less frequently and to glide for longer periods. A rough calculation based on our estimates of the proportion of time spent flapping and gliding in formation, and assuming that the overall costs of the glide–flap sequence is the sum of the gliding and flapping components, reveals an actual saving of 1.7–3.4% as a result of wake effects on power input — this value is comparable to that estimated for geese.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The main benefit of flight formation, which until now has not been recognized, could be that by flying in a vortex wake, pelicans are able to glide for a greater proportion of their total flight time, with the total energy savings of 11.4–14.0% being achieved primarily through this strategy.&#8221; (Weimerskirch et al. 2001:697)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '4349-0'}\n",

By adopting a head standing posture facing into the wind, the fog water collects on their elytra and runs down to their mouth, to be imbibed by the beetles. This unique behaviour is termed fog-basking [7]. The advantage of fog collection for water intake in the extremely arid desert is obvious, and becomes critical when rainfall is absent over prolonged periods of time. Long term studies on the population density of Darkling beetles in the Namib Desert clearly shows that the fog collecting beetles are still present in great numbers during periods of low rain fall, whereas the large majority of Darkling beetles that lack this adaptation disappear or decline to less than 1% of their mean abundance [5].” (Norgaard and Dacke 2010:1-2)</p>\\n', '', '', '<p>&#8220;&#8230;we investigated&#8230;the wetting and structural properties, of the surface of the elytra of a preserved specimen of <em>Physasterna cribripes</em> (Tenebrionidæ) beetle, where the macro-structure appears as a series of “bumps”, with “valleys” between them.

Their slime is believed to act as a defence mechanism against gill-breathing predators, as it has been shown to reduce water flow over the gills of fish. Hagfish slime is composed of two interacting components, slime thread skeins and mucin vesicles, which are both released from glands along the ventrolateral length of the animal. Each slime gland is surrounded by striated muscle and a connective tissue capsule, and contains large numbers of gland thread cells and gland mucous cells. Gland thread cells contain skeins of tightly coiled polymers rich in intermediate filaments, while gland mucous cells produce vesicles containing mucins, a class of glycoproteins. Both cell types rupture partially as they pass through the slime gland duct, causing each to lose its plasma membrane, and releasing both thread skeins and mucin vesicles into the external environment. The mucin vesicles are released by holocrine secretion rather than the more typical mechanism of mucus secretion through fusion of vesicles with the membrane of the mucous cell and release of mucin granules by exocytosis. In this way, the mucin vesicles remain intact until they come into contact with seawater in the external environment.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The mature slime is formed when exudate released from the hagfish contacts convectively mixing seawater. Agitation during mixing causes the thread skeins to uncoil to lengths of 10–17 cm, providing a large surface area to which the mucins released from the ruptured vesicles can attach. The fully formed slime is a complex network capable of confining seawater to channels between the slime threads and ruptured mucins like a fine sieve. The interaction between the thread skeins and ruptured mucins is critical for the production of the mature slime.&#8221; (Herr et al. 2010:1092; <em>in-line\\xa0citations removed from quote</em>)</p>\\n<p>&#8220;When agitated, Atlantic hagfish (<em>Myxine glutinosa</em>) produce large quantities of slime that consists of hydrated bundles of protein filaments and membrane-bound mucin vesicles from numerous slime glands. When the slime exudate contacts seawater, the thread bundles unravel and the mucin vesicles swell and rupture. Little is known about the mechanisms of vesicle rupture in seawater and stabilization within the gland, although it is believed that the vesicle membrane is permeable to most ions except polyvalent anions. We hypothesized that the most abundant compounds within the slime gland exudate have a stabilizing effect on the mucin vesicles. To test this hypothesis, we measured the chemical composition of the fluid component of hagfish slime exudate and conducted functional assays with these solutes to test their ability to keep the vesicles in a condensed state. We found K+ concentrations that were elevated relative to plasma, and Na+, Cl– and Ca2+ concentrations that were considerably lower. Our analysis also revealed high levels of methylamines such as trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), betaine and dimethylglycine, which had a combined concentration of 388 mmol l–1 in the glandular fluid. In vitro rupture assays demonstrated that both TMAO and betaine had a significant effect on rupture, but neither was capable of completely abolishing mucin swelling and rupture, even at high concentrations. This suggests that some other mechanism such as the chemical microenvironment within gland mucous cells, or hydrostatic pressure is responsible for stabilization of the vesicles within the gland.&#8221; (Herr et al. 2010:1092)</p>\\n', '<p>&#8220;&#8230;[hagfish] slime originates as a two-component glandular exudate comprised of coiled bundles of cytoskeletal intermediate filaments (thread skeins) and mucin vesicles&#8230;Deployment of the thread skeins involves their unraveling in a fraction of a second from a 150 µm-long ellipsoid bundle to a thread that is 100<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica\">x</span> longer. We hypothesized that thread skein deployment requires both vigorous hydrodynamic mixing and the presence of mucin vesicles, both of which are required for whole slime deployment.

Active slime secretion was not observed when the potential predator approached the hagfish, but only began when the predator either tried to bite or engulf the hagfish. The mechanism of localised control and coordination of slime glands, as observed in our video footage, has been documented in laboratory studies and was highly effective to allow a full escape.

The major constituents of the capsule wall are mini-collagens, a family of unusually short collagens&#8230;in a three-dimensional polymer stabilized by disulfide bonds&#8230;and [cross-linked] NOWA protein. They form a continuous supra-structure of the nematocyst wall&#8230;All nematocysts have a solid, elastic wall and a lid structure, which closes the capsule before discharge&#8230;the capsules of the highest structural complexity are found in hydrozoans. Here, the stenoteles represent one of the most sophisticated capsule types. The stenotele tubule is enlarged at its basal region, which is called the shaft. The distal shaft carries the stylet apparatus, which contains three huge stylets and three arrays of thinner spines. This stylet apparatus forms a dart when the tubule evaginates, which punches a whole into the prey’s cuticle through which the long tubule enters, releasing hemolytic and neurotoxic substances&#8230;The dart-like stylet apparatus can penetrate even thick crustacean cuticles&#8230;It is generally accepted today that the high osmotic pressure that is built up at the end of capsule morphogenesis in conjunction with the elastically stretched capsular wall is the main driving force of discharge. At the end of morphogenesis the capsule is maximally expanded and during discharge the volume gets suddenly reduced again by about 50%&#8230;The high osmotic pressure is generated by poly-γ-glutamate and&#8230;anions&#8230;They are responsible for the generation and regulation of an internal osmotic pressure that amounts up to 150 bar&#8230;a high osmotic pressure inside the capsule is the basic principle of all nematocysts.&#8221; (Özbek et al. 2009:1039)</p>\\n<p>&#8220;[T]he molecular assembly of the operculum enables it to react to the ionic changes preceding discharge by a molecular rearrangement facilitating capsule wall disintegration at this position. Thus, the release of the increased osmotic pressure would be directed to the preformed opening preventing a random rupture of the wall structure.&#8221; (Özbek et al. 2009:1040)</p>\\n<p>&#8220;[A]n action potential that is normally elicited when a prey mechanically deflects the sensory receptor of the cell, the cnidocil&#8230;extracellular calcium entering the nematocyte leads to fusion pore formation during nematocyst exocytosis&#8230;In phase B the nematocyst vesicle fuses with the nematocyte membrane, and the capsule’s discharge process starts. The most obvious event is that the lid is opened and the stylet-bearing portion of the tubule is ejected&#8230;an average velocity (y) of the stylet tip of 18.6 m/s is generated&#8230;5,413,000 x g is required to produce this average velocity (y) from a standing start. This high acceleration can explain how a small mass can generate sufficient force at the site of impact. The stylets are composed of a keratin-like protein and have an extremely narrow tip. Based on the accelerated mass and the stylets tip (80 nm2), a pressure (p) of 7.7 GPa was estimated when the stylet tip hits the prey. This force is in the range of technical bullets and explains how a 5 mm thick solid cuticle of a crustacean prey can be effectively perforated by a cnidarian nematocyst with a minimum of mass. This seems to be the fastest known process generated in animal systems&#8230;[prior to discharge] the cyst is in its maximally expanded state and only a minimal increase in pressure is sufficient to elicit discharge&#8230;Spinalin, a keratin-like glycine- and histidine-rich protein, is involved in the formation of spine and operculum structures.&#8221; (Özbek et al. 2009:1041)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '4779-0'}\n",

Anemonefishes are considered to use anemone mucus as “chemical camouflage” or “macromolecular mimicry” to avoid recognition as “not-self” by the anemone, and possible subsequent stinging.

In combination these two factors, fruit weight and the height of the fruit bearing branches, cause a high potential energy of the hanging fruit. After the fruit is shed its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy which reaches its maximum just before impact with the ground. If the high kinetic energy was to cause the pummelos to split open when impacting with the ground, the fruits would perish within a short time due to the tropical climate in Southeast Asia, the region of origin of the genus <em>Citrus</em>.&#8221; (Fischer 2010: B659)</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Semi-quantitative analyses of thin sections of pummelo peel revealed a gradual transition in density between exocarp and mesocarp.

The impact force acting on the pummelo depends on the velocity of the fruit before impact and its weight, but also on the consistency of the ground. Under natural conditions, part of the total energy is dissipated by the relatively pliable ground, as typically existing in the regions where pummelos grow naturally. In the tests presented mechanical loads acting on the fruits were increased by dropping the fruits onto a hard ground. Thus all kinetic energy must have been dissipated by the fruits themselves. The mesocarp with its air-filled intercellular spaces represents a compressible foam. As the Young’s modulus of this spongy part of the peel is rather low, we conclude that its ability to dissipate large amounts of energy must result from the structural composition of the peel.&#8221; (Fischer 2010: B662)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '4902-0'}\n",

We also performed nanomechanical measurements in water to determine the adhesion (1.9-7.2 nN or greater), resilience (43-56%), and elastic modulus (170-1035 kPa) of solid glue collected in different ways. Dry glue contains little carbohydrate and consists mainly of protein. The protein complement is rich in Gly (15.8 mol %), Pro (8.8 mol %), and Glu/Gln (14.1 mol %); it also contains some 4-hydroxyproline (4.6 mol %) but no 5-hydroxylysine or 3,4- dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa). Denaturing gel electrophoresis of the glue reveals a characteristic pattern of proteins spanning 13-400 kDa. The largest protein (Nb-1R, apparent molecular mass 350-500 kDa) is also the most abundant, and this protein appears to be the key structural component. The solid glue can be dissolved in dilute acids; raising the ionic strength causes the glue components to self-assemble spontaneously into a solid which resembles the starting material. We describe scattering studies on dissolved and solid glue and provide microscopy images of glue surfaces and sections, revealing a porous interior that is consistent with the high water content (85-90 wt %) of moist glue. In addition to compositional similarities with other biological adhesives and well-known elastomeric proteins, the circular dichroism spectrum of dissolved glue is almost identical to that for soluble elastin and electron and scanning probe microscopy images invite comparison with silk fibroins.

The hydrated solid is highly elastic and consists of a porous mesh that in clinical contexts should allow the diffusion of gases and nutrients. Since some of the cavity radii…equate to pores with diameters in excess of 10 µm, it is likely that the hydrated material will also permit a degree of cellular infiltration. Initial experiments suggest that the glue is highly biocompatible, and it has been used successfully to bond severed cartilage tissue both ex vivo and in vivo.&#8221; (Graham et al. 2005:3311)</p>\\n', '']}, 'objectID': '4450-0'}\n",

The light organs exist on the abdominal segments of a fire?y (<em>Luciola lateralis</em> Motschulsky) in males, as shown in Fig. 1B. Unlike the normal (N), the lantern (L) cuticle has longitudinal nanostructures with a highly ordered arrangement along the sagittal plane of a fire?y body (Fig. 1 C–E). The physical dimensions were statistically extracted from the SEM images. The period, height, and width roughly range near 250 nm, 110 nm, and 150 nm, respectively. For further investigation, the bioluminescent spectra were measured with a microscopic spectrometer and the result shows a center wavelength of 563 nm in males (68 nm in bandwidth). The transmittance of bioluminescent light (λ= 560 nm) through the lantern cuticle was calculated by using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) method (Fig. 1F). The refractive index of chitin as cuticle medium (reported value: 1.56) (20) was chosen for this FDTD calculation. The maximum transmission are clearly shown at 250 nm in period, 150 nm in width, and 110 nm in height, very similar to what is observed in nature. The nanostructured surface serves as a single layer with the calculated effective refractive index of roughly 1.24 (21), the thickness of which matches well with a quarter wavelength over the square root of refractive index in cuticular medium (i.e., the antireflection condition). This result indicates that the highly ordered cuticular nanostructures surrounding the ventral photogenic layer play an important role for reducing the index mismatch between air and the cuticle surface for high light extraction of bioluminescent light. For an anatomical perspective, a fire?y lantern consists of a dorsal layer, a photogenic layer, and a cuticle (Fig. 1G). The photogenic layer emits bioluminescent light in all directions. The light passes through the cuticle either directly or after reflecting off the dorsal layer, which is located under the photogenic layer and also known as a dielectric mirror (17, 18, 22).

Each is attached to rocks by twenty to sixty stringy byssus threads of sufficient tenacity to resist extreme hydrodynamic forces. (Denny [1988] provides an especially good view of the origin of these forces.) At first glance, a collagenous material looks inappropriate for the mission. After all, low extensibility means that unless particularly well matched and faced with forces of invariant strength and direction, only some subset of threads will bear the load. Imagine hanging from a group of inextensible ropes each of slightly different length&#8211;having more than one will gain you nothing, since they&#8217;ll break one by one instead of sharing the load.</p>\\n<p>A byssus thread contains two mechanically distinct regions, called, for their distance from the shell, proximal and distal. The material of both regions proves to be unusually extensible for collagens, which sounds right and proper. But then, according to Bell and Gosline (1996) things get more complex. The proximal region can be strained to a greater fraction of unloaded length, but it never achieves the breaking strength of the distal region, as you can see from figure 16.14a. So it looks as if their proximal regions take care of distributing the load among the threads. Not so. The distal region of threads happens to be two to four times longer and only half as wide. So a given force will stretch it quite far. Replotting the data as force against extension for a whole thread as a structure, as in figure 16.14b, shows a nice match. Even better, it shows how the distal thread yields (the horizontal portion of its curve) just short of the breaking force&#8211;an extension that will permit threads to reorient closer to the direction of the applied force and to share increasing loads among an increasing number of threads.&#8221; (Vogel 2003:347)</p>\\n', '']}, 'objectID': '4079-0'}\n",

The unique properties of these collagenous tissues might be due to lack of permanent associations between the collagen fibrils and the surrounding extracellular matrix because it is easy to isolate collagen fibrils from catch connective tissues – unlike collagenous tissues of adult vertebrates. It seems that crosslinking of the collagen fibrils with adjacent ones and other components of the extracellular matrix is formed or broken during changes in the mechanical properties of catch connective tissues.

The holothurian body wall dermis is a typical catch connective tissue that shows rapid and reversible changes in its mechanical properties in response to various stimuli.

To assess the role of epidermal cell shape in capturing direct vs. diffuse light, we measured leaf reflectance and transmittance with an integrating sphere system using leaves with flat (<em>Begonia erythrophylla, Citrus reticulata, and Ficus benjamina</em>) and lens-shaped epidermal cells (<em>B. bowerae, Colocasia esculenta, </em>and<em> Impatiens velvetea</em>).

Although it is common to characterize forest types by particular disturbance regimes, most forests are affected by various disturbances acting at different temporal and spatial scales (Fig. 3; 70-73). Organisms in natural forests have adapted, over evolutionary time, to the characteristic disturbance regimes of these forests. Boreal taiga forests and Mediterranean forests (74) are often disturbed by large-scale fires, while temperate deciduous forests, e.g. beech in Central Europe, mainly are affected by small-scale windthrows.&#8221; (Bengtsson et al. 2003:389, 392, 393)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '4556-0'}\n",

These threads form an orb web’s sticky prey capture spiral, which retains insects that strike the web, providing a spider with more time to locate and subdue their prey. Viscous threads are comprised of small, regularly spaced aqueous droplets that surround a pair of supporting axial fibers and are produced by a triad of spigots on each of a spider’s paired posterior spinnerets. The single flagelliform gland spigot of this triad produces an axial fiber and is flanked by two aggregate gland spigots, which coat this fiber with aqueous material. The coated axial fibers merge to form a contiguous pair of fibers surrounded initially by a sheath of viscous material. As a thread absorbs atmospheric moisture in the high humidity of the early morning hours, this material quickly condenses into a regular series of droplets whose size and spacing differ greatly among species.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The glycoprotein within each droplet that confers thread adhesion is encoded by two genes.

The asg2 gene produces a 714-amino-acid protein, whose upstream region is similar to known chitin-binding proteins, adapting it to adhere to insect exoskeleton, whereas its repeating downstream region has high proline content that resembles that of elastin and flagelliform spider silk, making it elastic.

In some, the cylinder of wood is divided into segments that alternate with soft tissue; in others, there are alternating cylinders of wood and soft tissue. Some woody vines also have flattened, ribbon-like stems to achieve greater flexibility.&#8221; (Dawson and Lucas 2005:17)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '3828-0'}\n",

These two properties, mainly provided by tannins, create optimal conditions for radiative temperature control. In addition, tannins seem to have adopted a function as mediators for excitation energy towards photo-antioxidative activity for control of radiation damage.&#8221; (Henrion and Tribusch 2009:98)</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Optimal reflection of incoming radiation is not the only condition for keeping surfaces cool. The second condition, optimal emission at a temperature that the object reaches (approximately 40 ºC) has also been demonstrated here. Barks, through tannin and cellulose, efficiently absorb radiation between 6 and 10 [microns] (Figs. 10, top and 12), which means that they emit radiation equally well in this wavelength region. It allows efficient thermal emission into the cool space via an optical atmospheric window between 7.5 and 13 [microns] (Fig. 6). Since leaves also have to cool down efficiently and therefore also have to emit radiation in this infrared optical window, it can be speculated that cellulose and tannins have been evolved, adopted, and applied because of their radiation properties. This could have been at least one of several evolutionary factors. As already mentioned the optical properties of tree barks are of course not the only factor that has been considered by evolution with respect to the heat balance of the tree bark. Many tree barks show a paper-like structure with sheets peeling off, generating highly heat-insulating, trapped air spaces between them (e.g. birch, paper-bark tree). Other tree barks have developed a very rough surface that produces a lot of shadowed areas amongst the illuminated ones [11]. Such a morphology is known to stimulate convection of air, which then transports away heat from the bark surface. An additional fact or that has been considered by evolution was, as already mentioned, the structure of tree stems and branches. They typically have a round profile, minimizing the surface with respect to the volume. For that reason, comparatively little solar heat can come in from the outside.&#8221; (Henrion and Tribusch 2009: 104-5)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '4093-0'}\n",

It&#8217;s neither a cheap nor a rapid way to go, a slug being the very paradigm of sluggishness. It is (or, strictly, was) a mysterious business. Slugs use neither cilia (as push the mucus lining our respiratory passages) nor peristaltic motion (as do, for instance, earthworms). How they propel themselves turns out to depend on that mucus, in particular on viscoelastic behavior more complex than anything we&#8217;ve seen so far.</p>\\n<p>The key can be seen if, with just the right lighting, one watches from beneath while a slug walks across a glass surface. Some kind of waves pass lengthwise; they&#8217;re about a millimeter or so in wavelength and travel at a couple of millimeters per second (fig. 17.7). It certainly looks as if the slug gets around by pushing back on its mucus, and that&#8217;s indeed what it does. But consider&#8211;that will work for one &#8216;step&#8217; only. Any operating system that pushes needs to recover if it&#8217;s to push again…At strains above 5 or 6 (higher values at higher strain rates), the mucus abruptly yields, transforming in a flash into a gooey liquid with a viscosity of 3-5 pascal-seconds&#8211;three thousand to five thousand times the viscosity of pure water. Stress falls abruptly, dropping by half, and the stress-strain curve goes flat and horizontal&#8211;stress now depends only on strain rate, as befits a fluid. Thus, the mucus can be pushed upon, propelling the slug forward, but when nudged just beyond that yield stress it turns to liquid. Then a bit of slug can slide forward across it and be ready to push backward again. Meanwhile, and critically, the mucus has to recover, to &#8216;heal&#8217; back into a viscoelastic solid, which it obligingly does forthwith. In life, a &#8216;step&#8217; is about a millimeter in length and the mucus layer is about 10 micrometers thick, so the strain gets up to around 100 during the recovery phase of each pedal wave. Beneath a given slug at a given time, all stages of the operation are taking place, with mucus in different states under different points along the animal.

The relevant combination of density and kinematic viscosity of air is much lower than for water… Analysis of published and unpublished underwater film leads us to present a hypothesis that free-ranging emperor penguins employ air lubrication in achieving high, probably maximal, underwater speeds (mean ± SD: 5.3 ± 1.01 m s–1), prior to jumps. Here we show evidence that penguins dive to 15 to 20 m with air in their plumage and that this compressed air is released as the birds subsequently ascend whilst maintaining depressed feathers. Fine bubbles emerge continuously from the entire plumage, forming a smooth layer over the body and generating bubbly wakes behind the penguins… From simple physical models and calculations presented, we hypothesize that a significant proportion of the enhanced ascent speed is due to air lubrication reducing frictional and form drag, that buoyancy forces alone cannot explain the observed speeds…” (Davenport et al. 2011: 171)</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Before jumping out of the water onto ice, the penguins swim at the surface and then dive on inspiration (Kooyman et al. 1971). We believe they dive with plenty of air in the plumage, with erected feathers making room for an air layer about 25 mm thick (following Du et al. 2007). Kooyman et al. (1971) described the grooming behaviour by which surface swimming emperor penguins load their plumage with air and we confirmed this by observation… They subsequently dive to ~15 to 20 m (by which depth the air volume will have decreased by a substantial amount…). During the dive, or when achieving that depth, they depress the feathers (to fix the plumage volume at the new, decreased level). When the birds swim quickly upwards, the decompressing air will flow out by virtue of the available fixed plumage volume being substantially less than the initial volume. Plumage consists of a fine, multi-layered mesh over the whole of the body surface comparable to a porous medium with an estimated pore size of &lt;20 μm (Du et al. 2007), so the expanding air will automatically issue as small bubbles. This arrangement resembles the flat-plate experiments of Sanders et al. (2006), who used a 40 μm pore size sintered stainless steel strip for microbubble air injection. The ‘active’ part of the process consists solely of maintenance of depressed feathers during the near vertical phase of the ascent in order to regulate expulsion of air driven by decompression. As bubbles continue to enter the boundary layer along the plumage, they are swept downstream and move outwards, thus increasing the void fraction in the boundary layer downstream to finally leave in the wake behind the bird; or they coalesce with other bubbles to form rather large bubbles at the outer edge of the boundary layer&#8230;&#8221; (Davenport et al. 2011: 175-176)</p>\\n<p>“…Emperor penguins ascending rapidly in the water column to jump onto ice shelves emit bubble clouds into the turbulent boundary layer over most of the body surface throughout their ascent.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy has demonstrated that free water content in stratum corneum is greater in central regions relative to superficial and deeper cell layers at moderate levels of hydration (57%–87%, w/w), whereas at higher levels of hydration (300% w/w) water swells corneocytes in a direction perpendicular to the skin surface except for the deepest cell layers adjacent to the viable epidermis (Bouwstra et al., 2003a). While the mechanism excluding free water from the deeper cell layers of stratum corneum is not understood, it is speculated to play a role in preventing dehydration of the viable epidermis. In relatively dry conditions (18%–26% w/w), only bound water is present in the stratum corneum (Bulgin and Vinson, 1967; Hansen and Yellin, 1972; Bouwstra et al., 2003a).&#8221; (Lillywhite 2006:202, 212, 213)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '3124-0'}\n",

A peculiarity of the dragonfly is its use of a rowing motion along an inclined stroke plane. During hovering, the body lies almost horizontal. The wings push backward and downward, and at the end of the stroke, feather and slice upward and forward. In contrast, many other hovering insects use a symmetrical back-and-forth stroke near a horizontal stroke plane. The dragonfly’s asymmetric rowing motion allows it to support much of its weight by the upward drag created during the downstroke; for the more common symmetric motion, the drag roughly cancels.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The dragonfly belongs to Odonata, one of the most ancient of insect orders. Its fore and hind wings are controlled by separate muscles, and a distinctive feature of the dragonfly’s wing movement is the phase relation between those wings during various maneuvers. When hovering, the fore and hind wings tend to beat out of phase; during takeoff, they tend to beat closer in phase. Why does a dragonfly vary the phase in different maneuvers? One plausible explanation is that alternating the downstroke reduces body oscillation. That is, however, only part of the story. The fore and hind wings are about a wing-width apart—close enough for them to interact hydrodynamically. To determine the amount of interaction, one solves the Navier–Stokes flow equations with boundary conditions set by the movement of the wings. The resulting flows are spectacular and complex. They depend on Reynolds\\xa0number, wing motion, wing shape, and phase difference.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Despite that complexity, two general results emerge: The aerodynamic power expended is reduced when the wings move out of phase, and the force is enhanced when the wings move in phase. When the fore and hind wings beat out of phase, they approach each other from opposite sides and cross near the midstroke. The fore wings experience an induced flow due to the hind wings, and vice versa. As a consequence, the drag on the wings is reduced, as is the power expended in flapping. But the reduction in drag on the two types of wing points in opposite directions, so the net force is essentially unaffected. In other words, the counterstroking allows the dragonfly to generate nearly the same force while saving aerodynamic power. If, instead, the fore and hind wings beat in phase, they will experience a higher drag due to the induced flow. In this case the increase in drag on all the wings points in the same direction. Thus the hydrodynamic interaction results in a greater net force that can be used to accelerate as needed during takeoff. The cost is greater power expenditure.&#8221; (Wang 2008:74)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '4973-0'}\n",

During blood feeding, only the fascicle penetrates into the skin while the labium buckles back to remain on the surface of the skin&#8230;[The mosquito] uses the two maxillas as variable frequency microsaws with nanosharp teeth to advance into the skin tissue.

The morphology of the flipper from a 9.02-m whale was evaluated with regard to this hydrodynamic function. The flipper had a wing-like, high aspect ratio plan- form. Rounded tubercles were regularly interspersed along the flipper&#8217;s leading edge. The flipper was cut into 71 2.5-cm cross-sections and photographed. Except for sections near the distal tip, flipper sections were symmetrical with no camber. Flipper sections had a blunt, rounded leading edge and a highly tapered trailing edge. Placement of the maximum thickness placement for each cross-section varied from 49% of chord at the tip to 19% at mid-span. Section thickness ratio averaged 0.23 with a range of 0.20-0.28. The humpback whale flipper had a cross-sectional design typical of manufactured aerodynamic foils for lift generation. The morphology and placement of leading edge tubercles suggest that they function as enhanced lift devices to control flow over the flipper and maintain lift at high angles of attack. The morphology of the humpback whale flipper suggests that it is adapted for high maneuverability associated with the whale&#8217;s unique feeding behavior.&#8221; (Fish and Battle 1995:51)</p>\\n', '<p>&#8220;The humpback whale <em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em> is exceptional among the baleen whales in its ability to undertake acrobatic underwater maneuvers to catch prey. In order to execute these banking and turning maneuvers, humpback whales utilize extremely mobile flippers. The humpback whale flipper is unique because of the presence of large protuberances or tubercles located on the leading edge which gives this surface a scalloped appearance. We show, through wind tunnel measurements, that the addition of leading-edge tubercles to a scale model of an idealized humpback whale flipper delays the stall angle by approximately 40%, while increasing lift and decreasing drag.&#8221; (Miklosovic et al. 2004:L39)</p>\\n', '']}, 'objectID': '5038-0'}\n",

The present study is concerned with one such snail, <em>Sphincterochila boissieri</em>, which occurs in the deserts of the Near East. Live specimens of this snail, withdrawn in the shell and dormant, can be found on the desert surface in mid-summer, fully exposed to sun and heat. The surface temperature of these deserts may reach 70 °C and more than a year may pass between rains</span><span id=\"tip_special_text\" class=\"form_tip\">…</span></p>\\n<p><span id=\"tip_special_text\" class=\"form_tip\"><br />\\n&#8220;The maximum air temperature, reached at noon, was 42.6 °C, and the maximum soil surface temperature in the sun, reached at 13.00, was 65.3 °C. Under the snail, in the space between the soil surface and the smooth shell, the maximum temperature was 60.1 °C, or 5.2 °C below the adjacent soil surface in the open sun. The lower temperature under the shell is expected, for the shell provides shade for that particular spot of the soil surface on which it sits. Inside the shell in the largest whorl, located in contact with the ground, the maximum temperature was 56.2 °C. In the second and third whorls the temperature was lower, reaching a maximum of 50.3 °C.</span></p>\\n<p>&#8220;It is important that the animal, when withdrawn, does not fill the shell and leaves most of the largest whorl filled with air<span id=\"tip_special_text\" class=\"form_tip\">…</span><span id=\"tip_special_text\" class=\"form_tip\">The snail, withdrawn to the upper parts of the shell, is significantly cooler</span><span id=\"tip_special_text\" class=\"form_tip\">…</span><br />\\n<span id=\"tip_special_text\" class=\"form_tip\"><br />\\n&#8220;Why does the snail not heat up to the same temperature as the soil surface? The answer lies in its high reflectivity in combination with the slow conduction of heat from the substrate. Within the visible part of the solar spectrum (which contains about one-half of the total incident solar radiant energy) the reflectance of these snails is about 90%. In the near infrared, up to 1350 nm, the reflectance is similar to that of magnesium oxide and is estimated to be 95%. In the total range of the solar spectrum, therefore, we can say that the snails reflect well over 90% of the incident radiant energy.</span></p>\\n<p><span id=\"tip_special_text\" class=\"form_tip\">&#8220;…</span><span id=\"tip_special_text\" class=\"form_tip\">heat flow, however, is impeded by two important circumstances. Firstly, the snail shell is in direct contact with the rough soil surface only in a few spots, and a layer of still air separates much of its bottom surface from the ground, forming an insulatng [sic] air cushion. Next, and perhaps more important, the snail is withdrawn into the upper parts of the shell and the largest whorl is filled with air; this constitutes a further impediment to heat flow into the snail.&#8221; (Schmidt-Nielsen et al. 1971:385, 388-9)</span></p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '4542-0'}\n",

Bacteria navigate using chemotaxis, i.e., moving according to gradients in the chemical concentration. Bacteria are too small to detect the chemical gradients across their body receptors, and thus detect the concentration as they swim, and delay their tumble if the concentration increases. As a result, they make longer excursions towards areas of higher concentration. Each bacterium may only acquire local and partial cues from the environment, but as a group bacteria can navigate through challenging environments.” (Shklarsh et al. 2011:1–2)</p>\\n', '<p>“Many animal swarms, Shklarsh explains, can be harmed by &#8220;erroneous positive feedback,&#8221; a common side effect of navigating complex terrains. This occurs when a subgroup of the swarm, based on wrong information, leads the entire group in the wrong direction. But bacteria communicate differently, through molecular, chemical and mechanical means, and can avoid this pitfall.</p>\\n<p>Based on confidence in their own information and decisions, ‘bacteria can adjust their interactions with their peers,’ Prof. Ben-Jacob says. ‘When an individual bacterium finds a more beneficial path, it pays less attention to the signals from the other cells. But at other times, upon encountering challenging paths, the individual cell will increase its interaction with the other cells and learn from its peers. Since each of the cells adopts the same strategy, the group as a whole is able to find an optimal trajectory in an extremely complex terrain.’&#8221; (Hunka 2011:1)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '4437-0'}\n",

We have shown that much of this behaviour can be attributed to a cocktail of six proteins, designated ranaspumins (Rsn-1 to Rsn-6), which predominate in the foam. These fall into two discernable classes based on sequence analysis and biophysical properties. Rsn-2, with an amphiphilic amino acid sequence unlike any hitherto reported, exhibits substantial detergent-like surfactant activity necessary for production of foam, yet is harmless to the membranes of eggs and spermatozoa. A further four (Rsn-3 to Rsn-6) are lectins, three of which are similar to fucolectins found in teleosts but not previously identified in a land vertebrate, though with a carbohydrate binding specificity different from previously described fucolectins. The sixth, Rsn-1, is structurally similar to proteinase inhibitors of the cystatin class, but does not itself appear to exhibit any such activity. The nest foam itself, however, does exhibit potent cystatin activity. Rsn-encoding genes are transcribed in many tissues of the adult frogs, but the full cocktail is present only in oviduct glands. Combinations of lectins and cystatins have known roles in plants and animals for defence against microbial colonization and insect attack. Túngara nest foam displays a novel synergy of selected elements of innate defence plus a specialized surfactant protein, comprising a previously unreported strategy for protection of unattended reproductive stages of animals.&#8221; (Fleming et al. 2009:1787)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '3914-0'}\n",

The body wall of a sea anemone–which can be quite substantial in size–consists of inner and outer surface layers separated by the thick mesoglea. One doesn’t go far wrong viewing the system as a tall can of seawater whose walls are mostly made of jelly…A typical anemone has a rare facility for changing shape, ranging from a low barrel to a tall cylinder with a few flourishes in between, over times ranging from seconds to hours…Obviously its mesogleal stuffing must participate in the process. Muscle drives some of the shape changes, in particular the sudden expulsion of water in the central cavity from its single apical opening. But tracts of cilia drive other changes, such as reinflation by pumping water back in. You may recall that<span id=\"tip_special_text\" class=\"form_tip\">…</span>ciliary pumps produce exceedingly low pressures, and here we’re asking that they pump up creatures that may reach half a meter in height and live in moving water.</p>\\n<p>Alexander (1962) showed the crucial role of mesogleal viscoelasticity for anemones. In creep tests on samples, strain increased from an initial value of about 0.2 to a final level ten times that, achieved after around 10 hours. That means the mesoglea has a lot of viscosity relative to its elasticity–it’s hard to make it do anything fast but fairly easy to make it change shape slowly. It has a retardation time (calculated by Biggs; see Vincent [1990]) of a little under an hour. How nice! The pulsating or reversing flows of waves passing above won’t sweep it about very much, but after it has hunkered down, the low-pressure ciliary pump will be adequate to pump it back up again, albeit slowly. It can stand up to a single wave but deflect in a tidal current that imposes the same drag. Furthermore, the anemone’s body wall can resist the stresses of its own short-term muscle contractions, so it can bend or straighten without getting an aneurysm whenever its muscles aren’t active.” (Vogel 2003:360-361)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '3628-0'}\n",

Individual vegetative cells in plants, unlike those in animals, are encased in a cellulose cell wall. The cellulose cell wall may be very thin, in cells that are actively dividing, as for example, in growing shoot or root tips. However, once developed into their mature form, the cell walls may become thicker, and additional substances, mainly lignins, incorporated into their structure. The cells themselves, then, contribute to the mechanical strength of the plant. Thin-walled cells when fully hydrated, are like small, pressurised containers. Mature cells, especially those with thick walls, have mechanical strength of their own, even without watery contents.

We speculate, rather, that Cr(VI) reduction is used here as a detoxification mechanism…Both of the common Cr(VI) anions, chromate (CrO42-) and dichromate (Cr2O72-), are strong oxidants, and chromate is a known carcinogen and a suspected mutagen and teratogen…it may cause oxidative or other cellular damage such as DNA breakage…The chromate oxyanion, due to its negative charge and high solubility, tends to be highly mobile and bioavailable. By contrast, Cr(III) often forms insoluble hydroxides at circum-neutral pH, and its toxicity and mobility are negligible under these conditions. Because of this decrease in solubility, toxicity, and mobility, reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is considered a beneficial reaction in many Cr-contaminated environments…Many Cr-contaminated habitats are acidic, including acid mine drainage and numerous industrial or government sites.” (Cummings 2007:146).</p>\\n<p>“<em>A. cryptum</em>\\xa0reduces Cr(VI) by at least two different mechanisms. In the first, Cr(VI) is directly reduced by cellular components…a role for cellular proteins in the process…By the second mechanism, Fe(III) is enzymatically reduced to Fe(II), which rapidly shuttles its electron to Cr(VI), reducing it to Cr(III) in three 1-electron transfers…The kinetics of Fe(III) reduction by\\xa0<em>A. cryptum</em>\\xa0appear to be much more rapid than those of direct Cr(VI) reduction, and the rate of abiotic reduction of Cr(VI) by Fe(II) is considerably faster than many enzymatic processes, so an indirect mechanism is likely to dominate the Cr(VI) reduction pathway in the presence of reducible Fe(III)…Reduction of Cr(VI) is not linked to energy conservation by\\xa0<em>A. cryptum</em>. Instead, Cr(VI) reduction by\\xa0<em>A. cryptum</em>\\xa0may be a detoxification strategy. The toxicity of Cr(VI) is due in part to the solubility and reactivity of the chromate anion, CrO42-. At circumneutral pH, reduction to Cr(III) leads to its precipitation as insoluble Cr(OH)3. The diminished toxicity of Cr(III) is assumed to be largely the result of the limited solubility of the trivalent hydroxide. As pH drops, however, the solubility of Cr(III) increases. Yet, its toxicity appears to be greatly diminished despite the elevated aqueous concentration…although Cr(III) remains predominantly soluble (or biomass-associated) under acidic conditions, it is nonetheless considerably less toxic to\\xa0<em>A. cryptum</em>\\xa0than Cr(VI).” (Cummings 2007:150).</p>\\n<p>“The Cr(III) was, therefore, likely associated with the biomass as a complex on cellular materials and free in aqueous solution, but not as an insoluble Cr(OH)3 precipitate.” (Cummings 2007:151).</p>\\n', '']}, 'objectID': '4679-0'}\n",

In addition to its functions to reduce water loss and provide a protective barrier, its mechanical properties may be significant to plant growth and development…We discovered that the ratio of carbohydrates to lipids is 1:7 in floral parts but 2:1 in leaf cuticle. Esterified cutin components represented about 80% of the cuticle and di-hydroxyhexadecanoic acids were the major monomers of cutin, regardless of origin. The cutin of elastic tissues is characterized by a higher content of tri-hydroxy monomers than the cutin of rigid tissues. The data suggest that hydroxyl groups enhance the hydrophilic character of the cuticle and contribute to cuticular elasticity.” (Marga et al. 2001:841)</p>\\n<p>“The most remarkable difference between elastic and rigid tissues was the 4- to 8-times-higher content of trihydroxy fatty acids of the elastic tissues. Because a similar decrease in the relative amount of the trihydroxy C18 monomers occurred during cuticle development in ripening tomatoes, elasticity appears to be associated with a higher number of hydroxyl groups. The higher amount of trihydroxy monomers in the cuticle of elastic tissue argues for increased hydration of such cuticle and against the potential for increased cross-linking capability, which would reduce flexibility.” (Marga et al. 2001:846)</p>\\n<p>“[T]he elasticity of cuticle depends on the amount of hydroxylated fatty acids. Contrary to the notion that more hydroxyl groups can serve as potential sites for cross-linking, the OH groups apparently determine the hydrophilicity of the cuticle and facilitate impregnation with water. As the cuticle ages, natural dehydration, possibly in conjunction with the increase of cross-linkers, most notably phenolic compounds, may lead to the often described hardening of mature cuticle…The content of phenolics was correlated with cuticular rigidity. Similar to the strengthening of the cell wall by lignins, the cuticle can also be expected to gain mechanical strength by increased cross-linking of phenolic compounds. Cutin-bound phenolics decreased as fl?oral tissue became more elastic.” (Marga et al. 2001:847)</p>\\n', '<p>“Hydration of the membranes caused a decrease in the modulus of ∼35–50% and generally increased the total extensibility.

The plant, shown in figure 21.4, never reaches a meter in height, so it’s not exactly a big tree. But, like trees, it has three parts, an attachment (holdfast), a column (stipe), and photosynthetic laminae (fronds). It stands against gravity, getting higher in dense stands, and it bends in response to lateral force, for it, waves. Unlike any tree, though, it responds to lateral force by bending until almost prostrate and then springing back upright. Concomitantwith that untreelike behavior are a set of most untreelike material properties, set out in a lovely paper by Holbrook, Denny, and Koehl (1991). Table 21.1 lists these, along with typical values for wood.</p>\\n<p><em>“Postelsia</em>‘s ‘trunk’ certainly looks wimpy next to wood. It gives rather than standing tall in the face of fierce force, getting from a high second moment of area just enough flexural stiffness to stand erect at all. Only in work of extension does it play in the same league as wood, although it gets its high value by quite a different tactic–high stretchiness instead of high strength. Regaining its erect posture depends on reinvesting that work of extension, which requires a high resilience, which it has. But, as Holbrook, Denny, and Koehl emphasized, the energy storage underlying that resilience undermines its toughness.\\xa0<em>Postelsia\\xa0</em>is notably brittle and sensitive to scratches–its stipe may be soft, but cracks propagate all too readily. Before dismissing this alga as just a lowly tree wannabe, bear in mind that it has extraordinarily high photosynthetic productivity and that it invests far more, proportionately, in photosynthetic organs than any ordinary tree. Its fronds represent no less than 38 percent of its energy content or 35 percent of its weight (Lawrence and McClintock 1988)–compare this with the trivial weight and burning yield of the annual leaf-fall of a tree that yields a cord or so (perhaps 2 metric tons) of dry firewood.” (Vogel 2003:434-435)</p>\\n', '<p>“Sea-palms\\xa0<em>Postelsia palmaeformis</em>\\xa0Ruprecht are annual brown algae that grow on wave-swept rocky shores, often forming dense stands. Unlike most macroalgae,\\xa0<em>Postelsia</em>\\xa0stands upright in air–like trees. The stipe flexibility that permits\\xa0<em>Postelsia</em>\\xa0to withstand waves is provided by the low elastic modulus<br />\\n(5-10 MPa) of stipe tissue; in spite of the weakness (low breaking stress, ~ 1 MPa) of this tissue, a large amount of energy ( ~ 100 kJ/m 3) is required to break a stipe because they can be extended by 20-25 % before breaking. Although made of such easily deformed tissue,\\xa0<em>Postelsia</em>\\xa0can stand upright in air due to the width (high second moment of area) and resilience of their stipes, but the brittleness (low work of fracture, 400-900 J/m 2) that accompanies this resilience renders them susceptible to breakage if they sustain deep scratches. Although wave-induced stresses experienced by individuals in aggregations are not lower than those experienced by isolated sea-palms, photon flux densities of photosynthetically active radiation within these dense groves are less than 10% of those above\\xa0<em>Postelsia</em>\\xa0canopies. A number of morphological features differ between canopy, understory, and isolated individuals.

Bacterial symbionts are particularly common in insects that feed exclusively on plant sap, whether it is phloem, which is relatively rich in carbohydrates but poor in amino acids and vitamins, or xylem, which is limited in carbohydrates, amino acids, and vitamins.” (McCutcheon et al. 2009:15394)</p>\\n', '', '<p>“Although previous studies have revealed that “Ca.

Hodgkinia” is harbored in the central bacteriocytes of Py. repanda. The localization of “Ca. Sulcia” and “Ca. Hodgkinia” within the bacteriocytes of Py. repanda is generally similar to previous observations of a few other cicada species (27–29). In comparison with the majority of auchenorrhynchan insects, cicadas develop a similar mechanism of transovarial transmission for the primary symbionts from one generation to the next. We clarified that Arsenophonus together with these two primary symbionts were released from the bacteriocytes into the hemolymph of cicadas, gathered around the posterior pole of the oocytes, emigrated through the cytoplasm of the follicular epithelium into the perivitelline space, and finally formed a characteristic symbiont ball in each egg.” (Huang et al. 2020:10)</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '3860-0'}\n",

This strategy promotes the survival of a species by dispersing seeds for propagation at greater distance. … However, scales of pine cones consist of dead cells. … Then, how can they move?

On the basis of this engineering perspective, we propose a number of measures that could be employed to enhance conservation efforts.”</p>\\n', '<p>“Sometimes being left high and dry is a good thing. Seaside arrowgrass, which inhabits saline habitats such as salt marshes, avoids waterlogging by farming raised clumps. Not only does it protect itself, it also creates drier habitats for other species, thus increasing species diversity in a habitat otherwise dominated by a few competitive, clonal species. Seaside arrowgrass forms clumps up to 2 m wide and 60 cm high. Waterlogging of the plant’s roots stimulates production of shallow roots that spread out at or above the surface, resulting in outward expansion of the clumps. As the clumps expand outward beyond about 40 cm, the interior shoots die out, resulting in a ring of seaside arrowgrass around a decomposing center. … The rings have higher organic content and lower water content than the surrounding substrate. The increased height of the rings is the main mechanism behind the increased diversity because with greater height, there is greater reductive potential, reduced salinity, and increased habitat heterogeneity.”</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '3762-0'}\n",

It stretches out its long, flexible, sticky, feeding tentacles crosswise to flow…like the main cables of an extension bridge but loaded by drag instead of gravity. According to Johnson (1993), extended straight from animal to anchor point, the tentacles could not withstand much drag. But by a combination of passive sagging and muscular activity, they extend ever farther as flow increases. Drag may increase with flow, but the tentacle-stretching tensile consequence of drag does not–tension in the tentacles remains almost constant over at least a sevenfold speed range.” (Vogel 2003:329)</p>\\n', '<p>Tentacles suspended perpendicular to flow responded to increasing velocity by increasing their sag. An analysis of tension in these tentacles, mathematically analogous to that applicable to suspension bridges, shows that sagging permits the tentacles to avoid increases in tension that would otherwise occur as flow increases. Force modulation was achieved by active muscular control rather than by passive material properties. Although these tentacles would certainly break in the experimental flows if they did not sag, the low tension achieved suggests that some other reason, such as limitations on the adherence of cilia and mucus, accounts for the level of tension observed. Because drag is maximum on tentacles oriented perpendicular to flow, reorientation of tentacles, either by sagging or by dangling parallel to flow, additionally reduces tension by reducing drag. Theoretical estimates of drag on tentacles oriented parallel to flow show that they are never in danger of being broken. Drag is sufficient, however, to assist in passive extension of tentacles. While reorientation is a common mode of drag reduction among marine organisms, sagging represents a novel mechanism of mediating structural forces resulting from flow.</p>\\n']}, 'objectID': '2844-0'}\n",

The splendid fur of the seal, for instance, provides no protection against getting wet; it gets soaked through in the water. And, when exposed to the air, wet fur presents a considerable risk of a chill. We must assume that wet fur represents an advantage for swimming.

Normally these worms form severely flattened cylinders; the fibers in their surface layers lie at angles to their long axes somewhere in the 40-70 degree range. Since they’re not circular cylinders, they contain less volume than they might, and they live beneath the curve of figure 20.2, in the region labeled ‘flaccid.’ If such a worm contracts longitudinal muscles it will get shorter, moving to the left along a horizontal line. Sufficient contraction will bring it up against the curve, where it finds itself circular in section and more turgid to boot. If the worm contracts circumferential muscles it gets longer, moving to the right, but again it gets more nearly circular and more turgid. Not all of these worms can change shape enough to hit the limiting line, but they all use this curious scheme in which shape and stiffness are predictably interrelated.

About twenty million years ago, grasses and grasslands appeared on earth. Grass (and, incidentally, wood) provides poor fodder. It yields little energy relative to its mass, so a grazer has to process huge volumes. Much of that energy comes as chemically inert cellulose, which mammals hydrolyze only by enlisting symbiotic microorganisms in rumen or intestine. It’s full of abrasive stuff like silicon dioxide and has lengthwise fibers that demand cross-wise chewing rather than rapid tearing. Long-lived grazers, concomitantly, have especially special teeth, with their components typically layered side by side, as in figure 16.5b. This odd-looking arrangement ensures that, while teeth may wear down<span id=\"tip_special_text\" class=\"form_tip\">…</span>they won’t wear smooth.
